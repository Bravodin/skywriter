To make sure that we're speaking the same language in this documentation and on the mailing lists, here is a list of the unique terminology that we commonly use on the Skywriter project.

Skywriter
:   The project code name for an in-browser code editor/IDE for open web
    developers.

CommonJS
:   An effort to create a standard library that runs across platforms and
    interpreters for JavaScript. Skywriter's code is organized into CommonJS
    modules.

Labs
:   parts of Skywriter that are in the official repository but have not yet
    settled to the point where they are "supported".

    refactoring started in September 2009 and completed in April 2010.

    the Skywriter community.
