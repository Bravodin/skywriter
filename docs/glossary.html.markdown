To make sure that we're speaking the same language in this documentation and on the mailing lists, here is a list of the unique terminology that we commonly use on the Bespin project.

Bespin
:   The project code name for an in-browser code editor/IDE for open web
    developers.

Boot
:   the part of Bespin required to make it run. The notion is that ultimately
    anything that is not required to boot will be a plugin. We also want to
    minimize what is in the Boot part of Bespin.

CommonJS
:   An effort to create a standard library that runs across platforms and
    interpreters for JavaScript. Bespin's code is organized into CommonJS
    modules.

Core
:   any officially supported parts of Bespin. This consists of the Boot part
    of Bespin plus any plugins that beyond the experimental stage.

Reboot
:   a major refactoring of Bespin's code, especially pertaining to the
    refactoring started in September 2009.

SC
:   SproutCore, web GUI toolkit used by Bespin after the Reboot.
