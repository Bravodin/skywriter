* [Manipulating Text Through Commands](commands.html) – almost every action
  you take in Bespin is represented by a command that's provided by a plugin.
  Plugins that you create can do the same kinds of things that Bespin's
  built in commands do. In this tutorial, we'll show you how to make
  a plugin that adds useful new commands to Bespin.
* [Adding to the GUI](gui.html) – we'll step through the creation of a
  toolbar component for Bespin to show how to add to Bespin's user interface
  and how to make your own plugins extendable.
