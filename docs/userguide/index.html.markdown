Bespin's History
----------------

The Bespin project was created by Ben Galbraith and Dion Almaer in 2008 and
then brought to Mozilla Labs at the end of that year. Following the first 
public release in February 2009, the Bespin team (now a combination of
Mozilla employees and open source contributors) produced a series of
releases up to version 0.4.4 in September 2009. After that, the project
"rebooted" the client side code to build a newer, better structure for
adding the planned features. In November 2009, the first reboot code was
released as Bespin Embedded 0.5. In April 2010, Bespin 0.7 became the
first rebooted client/server release.
