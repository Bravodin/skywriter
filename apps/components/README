This app will eventually be a test of various reusable components within
Bespin. It exists in lieu of automated unit tests for user-facing components
that are difficult to test automatically. Right now, it tests the TextInput
mixin only. To test the functionality of this mixin, use the following
procedure:

  * Verify that entering characters on the keyboard results in "inserted"
    messages appearing with the correct characters.

  * Verify that combining characters result in "inserted" messages appearing
    with the correct characters.

  * Verify that inserting characters with an IME results in an "inserted"
    message appearing with the correct characters.

  * Verify that pressing Ctrl/Cmd-X and Ctrl/Cmd-C result in "cut" and "copy"
    messages appearing, respectively.

  * Verify that selecting "Cut" and "Copy" from the browser menu bar result in
    "cut" and "copy" messages appearing, respectively.

  * Verify that pressing Ctrl/Cmd-V from the browser menu results in a "paste"
    message appearing.

  * Verify that choosing "Paste" from the browser menu bar results in a "paste"
    message appearing.
