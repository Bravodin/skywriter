Skywriter Embedded
===============

Quick Start
-----------

The "prebuilt" directory contains all of the files you need to get Skywriter
up and running right away.

Take a look at the Skywriter Embedders Guide (in the docs directory) for 
more information.

Customizing Skywriter
------------------

This package also allows you to change which features
are built into your Skywriter Embedded script, even including your own custom
features.

You'll need either Python 2.5 with simplejson or Python 2.6 to build your own
custom Skywriter.

For more information, look in the Skywriter Embedders Guide in the docs directory.
